## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version X.X.X or higher)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C0des-by-SAGAR/communion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd communion
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **Start the development server:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

- **Run tests:**

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **Build for production:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- **Eject configuration:**

  ```bash
  npm run eject
  ```

  **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back! Use this if you need to customize the build tool and configuration.
